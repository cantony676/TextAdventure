    <p>You and the dwarves became great comrades, fighting till the end of days. Together you took over the lands of the planet you had landed on and went on to overtake many more. Your power stretched far beyond what you had ever imagined. You fell in love with the dwarf king's daughter and eventually took over as king when the former monarch passed away. Eventually, however, you died because of a rotten tuna sandwhich. </p>
