     <p>The dwarves offer you large meals, and you foster a deep relationship with their leaders.</p>
     <p>Eventually, they offer you a way home, creating a portal out of a frying pan that arrived around the same time as you.</p>
     <p>The leader of the dwarves is sad to see such a great person leave his tribe. The rest of the dwarves loved you too. </p>
     <p>He begs you, "If you have any way, please stay. Otherwise take this modified phone to stay in contact with us"</p>
